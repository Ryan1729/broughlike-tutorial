		<h1>Stage 9 - Next steps</h1>

        You've crafted a complete game using JavaScript. What do you want to do next?

        <h2>Make it better</h2>
        Think about putting your own stamp on the game: different spells, unique monsters, change up the rules.

        <h2>Sharing the game</h2>
        You'll probably want to share your game with friends. One easy way is to zip up the project folder and just email it around.
        <br><br>
        Even easier for the player would be hosting it on a site like <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>
