		<h1>Stage 9 - Next steps</h1>

        You've crafted a complete game using JavaScript. Very cool. What do you want to do next?

        <h2>Making it better</h2>
        Think about putting your own stamp on the game: different spells, unique monsters, change up the rules.

        <h2>Sharing the game</h2>
        You'll probably want to share your game with friends. One easy way is to zip up the project folder and just email it around.
        <br><br>
        Even easier for the player would be hosting it on a site like <a href="https://itch.io/">itch.io</a>. It's super easy to upload an HTML game and have people play it right in their browser with no downloads.
        <br><br>
        Later, if you have dreams of launching a game on a platform like Steam, you'll need to get it packaged up into an executable insted of a plain old webpage. I had good luck with <a href="https://nwjs.io/">NW.js</a>. That's how I shipped Golden Krone Hotel.
        <h2>Learning more stuff</h2>
        Now that you know how to code without any libraries, perhaps it's time to try one out. I recommend <a href="https://ondras.github.io/rot.js/hp/">rot.js</a> for making roguelikes.
        <br><br>
        You might also want to learn all the best practices that I refused to show you. ðŸ˜‹ Sorry about all that. A good starting point for learning JavaScript in depth is the free book <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Don't Know JS</a>.
